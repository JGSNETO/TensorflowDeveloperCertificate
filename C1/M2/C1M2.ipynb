    "- Small images are better for less processing power needed. But we need to have small but still be able to recognize.\n",

    "1. Three layers.\n",
    "2. The last layer has 10 neurons in it because we have ten calsses of clothing in the dataset. They should always match.\n",
    "3. The first layer is a flatten layer with the input chaping by 28x28. Our images are 28x28, so we are specifying that this is the shape that we should expect the data to be in. Flatten takes this 28x28 square and turns it into a simple linear array.\n",
    "4. The midle layer or the \"hidden\" layer. This is a 128 neurons in it, and we think them like variables in a function. Now, there exists a rule that incorporates all of these that turns the (28x28) values of an ankle boot into the value nine, and similar for all of the other 70,000.\n"
