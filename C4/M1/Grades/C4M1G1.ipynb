    "### Question 1\n",
    "**What is a trend?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An overall consistent flat direction for data\n",
    "- An overall consistent upward direction for data\n",
    "- An overall consistent downward direction for data\n",
    "- An overall direction for data regardless of direction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: An overall direction for data regardless of direction  \n",
    "Explanation: A trend refers to the long-term movement or direction of data over time, which could be upward, downward, or flat.\n",

    "### Question 2\n",
    "**In the context of time series, what is noise?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unpredictable changes in time series data\n",
    "- Sound waves forming a time series\n",
    "- Data that doesn’t have a trend\n",
    "- Data that doesn’t have seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Unpredictable changes in time series data  \n",
    "Explanation: Noise refers to random fluctuations or errors in the data that do not follow any specific pattern or trend.\n",

    "### Question 3\n",
    "**What is an example of a Univariate time series?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fashion items\n",
    "- Baseball scores\n",
    "- Hour by hour weather\n",
    "- Hour by hour temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Hour by hour temperature  \n",
    "Explanation: A univariate time series involves observations of a single variable recorded over time at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "**What is autocorrelation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different\n",
    "- Data that automatically lines up seasonally\n",
    "- Data that doesn’t have noise\n",
    "- Data that automatically lines up in trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different  \n",
    "Explanation: Autocorrelation refers to the correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself, showing repeating patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "**What is a non-stationary time series?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- One that moves seasonally\n",
    "- One that is consistent across all seasons\n",
    "- One that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality\n",
    "- One that has a constructive event forming trend and seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: One that moves seasonally  \n",
    "Explanation: Non-stationary time series have statistical properties that change over time, such as seasonality or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "**What is imputed data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A good prediction of future data\n",
    "- A bad prediction of future data\n",
    "- Data that has been withheld for various reasons\n",
    "- A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data  \n",
    "Explanation: Imputed data refers to estimates used to replace missing or incomplete values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7\n",
    "**A sound wave is a good example of time series data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- True\n",
    "- False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: True  \n",
    "Explanation: A sound wave represents a sequence of values (amplitude) recorded at regular intervals, making it a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 8\n",
    "**What is Seasonality?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data aligning to the 4 seasons of the calendar\n",
    "- A regular change in shape of the data\n",
    "- Weather data\n",
    "- Data that is only available at certain times of the year\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: A regular change in shape of the data  \n",
    "Explanation: Seasonality refers to recurring patterns or cycles in data at regular intervals due to seasonal or periodic factors.\n"
