    "# Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In AI, particularly, CNNs(Convolution neural network), it refers to applying a filter/kernel to an input to extract features such as edges, textures, or patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How convolutions work in CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input: The input is usually a multi-dimentional array, such as an image. \n",
    "2. Filter: A smal matrix(e.g: 3x3, 5x5) with numerical values is slid over the input array. This kernel highlights specific features of the input. \n",
    "3. Sliding/Stiding: The kernel moves across the image with a certain step size. At each position, it performs an element-wise multiplication between the kernel and the overlapping input region.\n",
    "4. Result(Feature map): The summed result of these multiplications forms the feature map, which represents how well the feature encoded by the kernel is present in different regions of the input. "
