    "## Question 1: You used a sunspots dataset that was stored in CSV. What’s the name of the Python library used to read CSVs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. py_csv\n",
    "  2. CommaSeparatedValues\n",
    "  3. py_files\n",
    "  4. csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** csv\n",

    "## Question 2: Why is MAE a good analytic for measuring accuracy of predictions for time series?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. It doesn’t heavily punish larger errors like square errors do\n",
    "  2. It punishes larger errors\n",
    "  3. It biases towards small errors\n",
    "  4. It only counts positive errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** It doesn’t heavily punish larger errors like square errors do\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3: What is the expected input shape for a univariate time series to a Conv1D?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. (1,)\n",
    "  2. (window_size, 1)\n",
    "  3. ()\n",
    "  4. (1, window_size)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** (window_size, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Question 4: When you read a row from a reader and want to cast column 2 to another data type, for example, a float, what’s the correct syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. float f = row[2].read()\n",
    "  2. float(row[2])\n",
    "  3. Convert.toFloat(row[2])\n",
    "  4. You can’t. It needs to be read into a buffer and a new float instantiated from the buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** float(row[2])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5: How do you add a 1 dimensional convolution to your model for predicting time series data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. Use a 1DConv layer type\n",
    "  2. Use a 1DConvolution layer type\n",
    "  3. Use a Conv1D layer type\n",
    "  4. Use a ConvolutionD1 layer type\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** Use a Conv1D layer type\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6: If your CSV file has a header that you don’t want to read into your dataset, what do you execute before iterating through the file using a ‘reader’ object?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. next(reader)\n",
    "  2. reader.ignore_header()\n",
    "  3. reader.read(next)\n",
    "  4. reader.next\n",

    "## Question 7: After studying this course, what neural network type do you think is best for predicting time series like our sunspots dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternatives:**\n",
    "  1. RNN / LSTM\n",
    "  2. Convolutions\n",
    "  3. DNN\n",
    "  4. A combination of all other answers\n",
