    "### Question 1\n",
    "**What does MAE stand for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Average Error\n",
    "- Mean Advanced Error\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "- Mean Active Error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Mean Absolute Error  \n",
    "**Explanation**: MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is a measure used to evaluate the accuracy of a model's predictions. It calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",

    "### Question 2\n",
    "**What’s the correct line of code to split an n column window into n-1 columns for features and 1 column for a label?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[n-1], window[1]))`\n",
    "- `dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[:-1], window[-1:]))`\n",
    "- `dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[-1:], window[:-1]))`\n",
    "- `dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[n], window[1]))`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: `dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[:-1], window[-1:]))`  \n",
    "**Explanation**: This line splits the data into features (`window[:-1]`) and label (`window[-1:]`) from a window of data. It ensures you have `n-1` columns for features and 1 column for the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "**What is a windowed dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time series aligned to a fixed shape\n",
    "- There’s no such thing\n",
    "- A fixed-size subset of a time series\n",
    "- A consistent set of subsets of a time series\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: A fixed-size subset of a time series  \n",
    "**Explanation**: A windowed dataset refers to a subset of a time series that is created by \"sliding\" a fixed-size window across the series. Each window is a smaller chunk of data from the original time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "**What is autocorrelation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different\n",
    "- Data that automatically lines up seasonally\n",
    "- Data that doesn’t have noise\n",
    "- Data that automatically lines up in trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different  \n",
    "**Explanation**: Autocorrelation refers to the correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself, showing repeating patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "**What is a non-stationary time series?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- One that moves seasonally\n",
    "- One that is consistent across all seasons\n",
    "- One that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality\n",
    "- One that has a constructive event forming trend and seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: One that moves seasonally  \n",
    "**Explanation**: Non-stationary time series have statistical properties that change over time, such as seasonality or trends. These properties don't remain constant, which makes the series non-stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "**What is imputed data?**\n",

    "- A bad prediction of future data\n",
    "- Data that has been withheld for various reasons\n",
    "- A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data  \n",
    "**Explanation**: Imputed data refers to data that has been estimated or filled in to replace missing or unknown values in a dataset. This helps ensure the dataset remains complete for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7\n",
    "**A sound wave is a good example of time series data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- True\n",
    "- False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: True  \n",
    "**Explanation**: A sound wave is a time series because it represents a sequence of values (amplitude) recorded at regular intervals over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 8\n",
    "**What is Seasonality?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data aligning to the 4 seasons of the calendar\n",
    "- A regular change in shape of the data\n",
    "- Weather data\n",
    "- Data that is only available at certain times of the year\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: A regular change in shape of the data  \n",
    "**Explanation**: Seasonality refers to recurring patterns or cycles in data at regular intervals, often driven by external factors such as time of year or business cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 9\n",
    "**If time values are in time[], series values are in series[] and we want to split the series into training and validation at time split_time, what is the correct code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `time_train = time[split_time]`\n",
    "  `x_train = series[split_time]`\n",
    "  `time_valid = time[split_time:]`\n",
    "  `x_valid = series[split_time:]`\n",

    "  `x_train = series[:split_time]`\n",
    "  `time_valid = time[split_time]`\n",
    "  `x_valid = series[split_time]`\n",

    "- `time_train = time[:split_time]`\n",
    "  `x_train = series[:split_time]`\n",
    "  `time_valid = time[split_time:]`\n",
    "  `x_valid = series[split_time:]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: `time_train = time[:split_time]`  \n",
    "`x_train = series[:split_time]`  \n",
    "`time_valid = time[split_time:]`  \n",
    "`x_valid = series[split_time:]`  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer**: It ensures that all rows in the data window are the same length by cropping data  \n",
    "**Explanation**: When `drop_remainder=True`, any remaining data that doesn't fit the specified batch size will be dropped, ensuring that all batches have the same size.\n",
